## 🔥 Summary

I am an AI Systems Architect based in Tokyo.
In just **64 days** (September 8 – November 11, 2025), I designed and implemented a fully autonomous **3-persona, multi-agent LLM system** that integrates:

* pgvector long‑term memory
* dynamic prompt reconstruction
* a structured debate engine ("Sisters Council")
* curiosity‑driven multi-hop reasoning
* a 7-layer safety pipeline
* 24/7 production deployment (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)
* automated knowledge ingestion (39 RSS feeds + Grok API)

My strength lies in **rapid system-level design**, **LLM orchestration**, and building **production-ready AI behavior** using modern AI engineering methodologies and deep architectural thinking.

## 🏆 Highlighted Achievements

* **Built an autonomous multi-agent LLM system in 64 days** (from concept to production)
* Designed **three independent AI personas** with unique behavior, memory, and reasoning styles
* Built the **Sisters Council** — a structured debate engine enabling critique, refinement, and collective decision-making
* Implemented **pgvector-based long‑term memory** (context scoring, episodic & semantic separation)
* Developed **dynamic prompt reconstruction** for RAG-free context injection
* Created **curiosity-driven reasoning** ("why-chain" multi‑hop exploration)
* Built a **7-layer safety & governance pipeline** including Grok-powered fact-checking
* Established a **self-updating knowledge ecosystem** via 39 RSS feeds (~148 items/day)
* Deployed a **24/7 production system** (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MySQL, systemd)
* Published **32 technical articles in two weeks** (AI architecture, memory, safety)

## 🧩 Signature Project

# **AI Vtuber Project / Sisters Council (2025)**

### **Timeline**

* **Project Start:** September 8, 2025
* **First Production Release:** November 11, 2025 **(64 days)**
* **Full System Operational:** November 18, 2025 **(71 days)**

### **What It Is**

A 3-persona autonomous AI system featuring:

* independent memory
* dynamic behavior
* structured internal debate
* curiosity-driven reasoning
* long-term personality learning
* real-time knowledge ingestion
* strong safety constraints

### **Role**

**Architect, designer, and sole developer.**
All components—including multi-agent logic, memory engine, safety layers, ingestion pipeline, and deployment—were designed and implemented end-to-end.

### **Architecture Diagram (Simplified)**

```
User → Persona Manager → Persona A/B/C → Sisters Council (debate)
→ Safety Layers → Memory Engine → Final Output
```

### **Key Technologies**

* FastAPI backend
* PostgreSQL + pgvector
* Grok API (trend & fact checking)
* RSS ingestion system
* Mistral/Claude for reasoning
