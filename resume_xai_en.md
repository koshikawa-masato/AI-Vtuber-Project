## Professional Summary

Autonomous AI Systems Architect with 26 years of technical career across CAD/Network, full-stack engineering, and AI systems. At age 50 (born 1975), recently achieved a breakthrough: in **47 business days** (Sep-Nov 2025), single-handedly built and 24/7-deployed **"Sisters Council"** — a fully autonomous 3-persona LLM agent platform with individual long-term memory, internal debate engine, curiosity-driven reasoning, and 7-layer safety architecture.

**Grok API Integration**: Built daily trend ingestion pipeline processing 39 RSS feeds + Grok API (grok-4-fast) → 148 facts/day, achieving **98% cost reduction** vs. GPT-4 while maintaining real-time accuracy.

Currently scaling toward AI-resident communities on X and Discord, with production migration to cost-optimized multi-LLM orchestration (Kimi k2-turbo: 256k context, $0.05/1M tokens).

## Key Achievements – The 47-Day Solo Project (2025)

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- Designed & deployed production multi-agent LLM system with 3 independent personas
  - pgvector-based long-term memory (256k context per character)
  - Dynamic prompt reconstruction (up to 168k tokens with Kimi k2-turbo)
  - Why-chain multi-hop reasoning (curiosity-driven 3-loop deep-dive)

### Sisters Council – Autonomous Debate Engine
- Built structured consensus protocol (Fix1-7: Introduction → Thesis → Development → Conclusion)
- Enables collective decision-making across 3 personas with conflict resolution
- Real-time sentiment analysis & toxic response conversion ("pro-wrestling" safety layer)

### Knowledge Ingestion Pipeline
- Daily automated trend collection: 39 RSS feeds + Grok API integration
- 148 facts/day ingestion with curiosity-triggered deep-dive (3x multi-hop reasoning)
- PostgreSQL + pgvector storage for semantic retrieval (similarity threshold: 0.6+)

### 7-Layer AI Safety System
- **Layer 1**: Pattern DB (instant toxic phrase blocking)
- **Layer 2-4**: LLM-based sentiment analysis, context judgment, multi-agent review
- **Layer 5**: VTuber-style "pro-wrestling" response conversion (humor-first safety)
- **Layer 6-7**: Developer escalation & audit logging
- **Result**: Zero toxic responses in 2,000+ production conversations

### Cost Optimization & Performance
- Grok-4-fast integration: **98% cost reduction** vs. GPT-4 ($0.20/M vs. $2.50/M input)
- Kimi k2-turbo migration (in progress): 256k context at $0.05/1M tokens (3× cheaper than GPT-4o-mini)
- Multi-LLM orchestration: Claude (safety), Grok (trends), Kimi (daily responses), Gemini (security audit)
- **Result**: $50/month → $15/month (70% cost reduction) while scaling to 24/7 operation

### Full-Stack Production Deployment
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL/pgvector + systemd + VPS 24/7 uptime
- Secure webhook tunneling (ngrok) with HMAC signature verification

## Personal Statement

At 50 years old, I've spent my entire adult life pursuing technical mastery across three distinct eras of technology:

1. **CAD/Network Era (1999-2017)**: 18 years mastering computer-aided design and network infrastructure
2. **Full-Stack/Embedded Era (2018-2025)**: 7 years shipping production systems across backend, mobile, and embedded
3. **Autonomous AI Era (2025-present)**: The 47-day breakthrough that brings it all together

What sets me apart isn't just the breadth of experience — it's the acceleration. Each era built on the last, compounding my ability to ship faster and think deeper. The Sisters Council project proves that 50 years of technical devotion can culminate in something truly unprecedented.

I'm ready to bring this unique combination of maturity, speed, and Grok expertise to xAI's mission.
