## 🚀 Summary

I am an **AI Systems Architect** based in **Osaka**, specializing in **multi-agent orchestration, memory-augmented LLM systems, and dynamic prompt reconstruction**.

In just **47 business days** (September 8 – November 11, 2025), I designed and built a fully autonomous multi-agent LLM system, including:

* pgvector long-term memory
* structured debate engine (Sisters Council)
* curiosity-driven reasoning
* 7-layer safety governance
* persona modeling
* 24/7 production deployment
* daily knowledge ingestion pipelines (39 RSS feeds + Grok API)

This system's architecture **naturally aligns with** Mistral Agents API concepts: function calling, memory tools, and RAG-free orchestration.

I believe this project could be an excellent fit for:

* Mistral **Agent API cookbook examples**
* Mistral **DevRel educational content**
* Mistral **Solutions / Applied AI** architecture patterns
* Open-source **multi-agent frameworks** in the Mistral ecosystem

## 🏆 Key Achievements (Mistral-Relevant)

### **⚡ Built a fully autonomous multi-agent LLM system in 47 business days** (Sep 8 – Nov 11, 2025)

* Designed **3 independent personas** with unique memory + reasoning
* Created the **Sisters Council**: a structured multi-agent debate engine
* RAG-free **dynamic prompt reconstruction engine**
* Implemented **pgvector memory**: scoring, episodic/semantic storage
* Built **curiosity engine** → multi-hop "why-chain" reasoning
* Trend understanding via RSS (39 feeds, ~148 items/day) + Grok API
* 7-layer **safety & governance pipeline** (including fact-checking)
* 24/7 **production deployment** (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + systemd)
* Published **32 technical articles in 2 weeks** on Qiita (AI architecture, memory, safety)

### Why This Matters for Mistral

Your Agents API emphasizes:

* multi-agent orchestration
* Python execution
* memory + context management
* reasoning loops
* controllable persona modeling

My system demonstrates all of these concepts **built manually from scratch**, making it highly adaptable to Mistral's upcoming agent frameworks.

## 🧩 Signature Project — Sisters Council (2025)

### Timeline

* **Project Start:** September 8, 2025
* **First Production Release:** November 11, 2025 **(47 business days)**
* **Full System Operational:** November 18, 2025 **(52 business days)**

### Overview

A three-persona AI system with:

* persona-specific memory (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
* structured internal debate ("Sisters Council")
* curiosity-driven reasoning (multi-hop exploration)
* personality learning (trust, closeness, playfulness)
* real-time world updates (39 RSS feeds + Grok API)
* strong, multi-layered safety (7-layer governance pipeline)

### Architecture (Simplified)

```
